# Robot_ThymioII: Deep Learning (Q-Learning Algorithm)

- piCamera + Lidiar Sensor + Thymio's Sensors
- Raspberry Pi 4

Q-learning is a machine learning approach that enables a model to iteratively learn and improve over time by taking the correct action. IT is also a type of reinforcement learning.

With reinforcement learning, a machine learning model is trained to mimic the way animals or children learn. Good actions are rewarded or reinforced, while bad actions are discouraged and penalized.

With the state-action-reward-state-action form of reinforcement learning, the training regimen follows a model to take the right actions. Q-learning provides a model-free approach to reinforcement learning. There is no model of the environment to guide the reinforcement learning process. The agent -- which is the AI component that acts in the environment -- iteratively learns and makes predictions about the environment on its own.
